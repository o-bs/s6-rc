      <h2 class="content-subhead" id="stypes"> Service types </h2>

      <p>
        In all genericity, a <em>service</em> is a basic unit that can undergo a
        transition; but not all services can be handled the same way. Services
        are divided into several categories, which we call <em>types</em>; these
        are the following.
      </p>

      <ol>
       <li> <strong>Longrun</strong>.

        <p>
          A <em>longrun</em> is the "traditional" definition of a service,
          implemented by a <em>long-lived process</em>, a.k.a. a daemon. As a first
          approximation, it means that when the daemon is alive, the service is up,
          and when the daemon is not present, the service is down. Longruns are the
          most common type of service, and the main reason why it's a good thing for
          a service manager to work in tandem with a process supervisor: the details
          of keeping the daemon alive, surveying its readiness, etc. are delegated
          to the process supervisor, which abstracts some complexity away from the
          service manager.
        </p>
       </li>

       <li> <strong>Oneshot</strong>.

        <p>
          A <em>oneshot</em> is a service that represents a state change in the
          machine, but that does not need a daemon because the state is maintained by
          the kernel. For instance, "mounting a filesystem" and "setting a sysctl" are
          oneshots: the service is considered <em>up</em> when the filesystem is mounted
          or the sysctl has been performed, and <em>down</em> when the filesystem is
          unmounted or the sysctl has its default value. Note that it's generally
          meaningless to revert a sysctl (and in most cases it's also a bad idea to try
          and unmount filesystems before the very end of a shutdown procedure), so it is
          quite common for the <em>down transition</em> of a oneshot to be a nop: after
          the first time the service has been brought up, the state basically never
          changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Longruns</em> and <em>oneshots</em> are collectively called <em>atomic
          services</em>. They are the core service types, the ones that actually do the
          work. Other service types are just convenience tools around them.
        </p>
       </li>

       <li> <strong>External</strong>.

        <p>
          An <em>external</em> is a service that is not handled by the
          service manager itself, but by a system that is external to it. It is a way for
          the service manager to delegate complex subsystems to other programs such as a
          network manager. The service manager does not know how to perform transitions
          for an external, it does not know anything but its name.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is impossible to set the <em>wanted state</em> of an <em>external</em>: such
          a service has to be triggered entirely outside of the service manager. All the
          service manager does is receive events that inform it of the external's <em>current
          state</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consequently, an <em>external</em> does have any dependencies. It is, however,
          possible for a service to depend on an external &mdash; that is their intended use,
          gating the transition of another service to the reception of an external event.
        </p>
       </li>

       <li> <strong>Bundle</strong>.

        <p>
          A <em>bundle</em> is a pseudo-service representing a set of services: it is used
          to implement service conjunction (<tt>AND</tt>). when a
          bundle is <em>wanted up</em>, it means that <em>all</em> the services it
          contains are <em>wanted up</em>. A bundle's <em>current state</em> is <em>up</em>
          if <em>all</em> the services it contains are up, and it is <em>down</em> otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when a bundle is <em>wanted down</em>, it also means that <em>all</em>
          (and not just one!) of the services it contains are <em>wanted down</em>, so take
          care when explicitly bringing down bundles.
        </p>
       </li>

       <li> <strong>Virtual</strong>.

        <p>
          A <em>virtual</em> is a pseudo-service representing a set of services, but used for
          disjunction (<tt>OR</tt>) instead: instead of meaning "all the services in the set", it means
          "one of the services in the set". A virtual's <em>current state</em> is <em>up</em>
          if at least one of the services it represents is <em>up</em>, and <em>down</em>
          otherwise.
        </p>
       </li>
      <ol>

      <h2 class="content-subhead" id="instances"> Dynamic instantiation </h2>

      <p>
        In all genericity, a <em>service</em> is a basic unit that can undergo a
        transition; but not all services can be handled the same way. Services
        are divided into several categories, which we call <em>types</em>; these
        are the following.
      </p>



       <li> <strong>Dynamically instantiated longrun</strong>.

        <p>
          A <em>dynamically instantiated longrun</em>, or <em>DIL</em>, is a template for
          an indeterminate amount of <em>longruns</em> that all follow the same model,
          and that differ by one parameter, the <em>instance name</em>. They are used
          to implement sets of similar services that the user will want to start on
          demand: for instance, a set of gettys. A <em>DIL</em> is identified by a
          <tt>@</tt> at the end of the service name; anything that follows the <tt>@</tt>
          is the <tt>instance parameter</tt>. For instance, <tt>getty@</tt> can be the name
          of the <em>DIL</em> spawning the gettys, and <tt>getty@tty2</tt> can be a
          dynamic instance of <tt>getty@</tt> with <tt>tty2</tt> as the <em>instance
          parameter</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          (It is possible to define a regular, <em>static</em> (as opposed to dynamically
          instantiated), <tt>getty@tty1</tt> service even if
          the <tt>getty@</tt> DIL exists: in that case, <tt>getty@tty1</tt> will always
          refer to the static service and it will be impossible to spawn a <tt>getty@</tt>
          instance with <tt>tty1</tt> as an instance parameter. This can be a good way to
          ensure that specific "instances" are special-cased.)
        </p>

        <p>
          However, DILs have a strong limitation: only dynamically instantiated services
          can depend on them, and only <em>with the same instance parameter</em>. In other
          words: <tt>B</tt> cannot depend on <tt>A@</tt>, only <tt>B@</tt> can depend on
          <tt>A@</tt>, and that means that for any <tt>x</tt>, <tt>B@x</tt> depends on
          <tt>A@x</tt>.
        </p>
